#+TITLE: Notes for number letter counts problem

Retrospective.

Building up tests slowly helped a lot. Got some inspiration from
Jim Weirarch's coding kata video on [[https://youtu.be/ronr_CG8x0Y][youtube]]

- Feel like appending an 'and' to hundreds when appropriate should
  be delegated to another method using the "tell not do" principle as the 
  ~number_to_word~ method is starting to get a little large.

- Feel like I should start to make more of an effort to add RDoc info to
  the source code using SPD principles.
