#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Product in Grid

* 1st solution proposed
Suggest having a Grid class responsible for parsing the string into
a 20 x 20 grid and returning an array. Additionally have a GridSequence
class responsible for taking a grid and sequence length and returning
(through each ?) all contigous sequences of that length either horizontally,
vertically or diagonally.

* Contracts
Grid.new string, length, depth
GridSequence.new grid, sequence_length

* Retrospective
