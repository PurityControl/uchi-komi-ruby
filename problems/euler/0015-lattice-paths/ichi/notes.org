#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Lattice Paths

The number of lattice paths for a n x n grid is (2n)! / (n!)**2.
This is based on a property of pascals triangle covered in combinatrics
ie.
(length of side (a) + length of side (b))! / length side (a)! * length side (b)!

* Retrospective
This is a very efficient and simply mathematical solution to implement.
Another iteration using a breadth first graphing algorithm would be interesting
from both a brute force speed perspective and as an exercise for the algorithm
implementation.
