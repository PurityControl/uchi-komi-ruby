#+TITLE: Highly Divisible Triangular Number

* Problem description

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. 
So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
The first ten terms would be:

: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

: 1: 1
: 3: 1,3
: 6: 1,2,3,6
: 10: 1,2,6,10
: 15: 1,2,6,10,15
: 21: 1,2,6,10,15,21
: 28: 1,2,6,10,15,21,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
