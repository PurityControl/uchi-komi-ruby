#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Highly Divisible Triangular Number

The number oof factors that a number has can be calculated from its prime
factors.

Each prime factor has a power and the number of factors is the product of
each factors power + 1

eg 54 is:

2**1, 3**3
and so the number of factors is (1+1) * (3 + 1) = 8

* Retrospective
I had problems reducing the api surface area. I could not make the num_divisors
method private. This is because it is called from the block passed to the
Enumerator functions and therefore self has a different scope than an instance
of the class.
