#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of largest prime factors

1st solution using ruby native prime generation library

1st attempt brute force method just to get right answer - iterate through
all primes up to the number in question finding the largest one that is
divisible.

This did not work however the generation of all the primes up to such a
large number took to long.

Settled with continually finding the smallest prime factor, calculating
its complement and then calculating the smalles prime on that recursively.
Once we have all the primes we can just get the maximum prime in the list
of prime factors
