#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of smallest multiples

1st solution with idea of using ruby lazy evaluation to give an
infinite sequence of multiples

THIS IS NOT A WORKING SOLUTION. THE IMPLEMENTATION IS SLOW. IT SEEMS TO
BE CORRECT IN SO FAR AS THE RESULT IS CORRECT FOR MULTIPLES UP TO 10
BUT IT HAS TO BE HALTED AFTER 5 MINS WHEN A SOLUTIONS STILL HASN'T BEEN FOUND
FOR MULTIPLES UP TO 20.
