#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of smallest multiples

1st solution with idea of using ruby lazy evaluation to give an
infinite sequence of multiples

THIS IS NOT A WORKING SOLUTION. THE IMPLEMENTATION IS SLOW. IT SEEMS TO
BE CORRECT IN SO FAR AS THE RESULT IS CORRECT FOR MULTIPLES UP TO 10
BUT IT HAS TO BE HALTED AFTER 5 MINS WHEN A SOLUTIONS STILL HASN'T BEEN FOUND
FOR MULTIPLES UP TO 20.

This does work but takes too long see test results below

Fabulous run in 227.054940s, 0.0176 runs/s, 0.0264 assertions/s.

Test is take a little under 4 minutes to complete on a desktop machine
