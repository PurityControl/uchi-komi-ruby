#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Longest Collatz

create distinct collatz class as enumerator of collatz sequence.
Then have helper class that creates a tuple of each number and
the length of the collatz sequence returning the one with the
longest collatz sequence


* Retrospective
once collatz class was implemented then mapping over them to
find the largest sequence was straightforward.
