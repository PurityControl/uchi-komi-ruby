#+TITLE: Notes for first repetition of gedcom parser

* Implementation thoughts
** Classes
GedcomParser takes a file and Parses the file line by line
returning instances of a class that takes arguments for level, tag and data 

GedcomWriter takes a class responsible for creating a gedcom file
in a certain format. It passes on each GedcomLine to the formatter
until the report is written.


* Features

- [X] implement test for file contract
- [ ] implement test for class contract passed
  into each_object
- [ ] get xmlwriter.save to take a block allowing it to sort out
  writing and close the file
- [ ] should the xml writer know about its input_stream?

* Questions
** Refactoring

* Retrospective
