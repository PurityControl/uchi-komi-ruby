#+TITLE: Notes for first repetition of gedcom parser

* Implementation thoughts
** Classes
GedcomParser takes a file and Parses the file line by line
returning instances of a class that takes arguments for level, tag and data 

GedcomWriter takes a class responsible for creating a gedcom file
in a certain format. It passes on each GedcomLine to the formatter
until the report is written.


* Features
** TODO Tasks
- [X] implement test for file contract
- [X] implement test for class contract passed
  into each_object
- [X] refactor each implementation - currently too complicated
- [X] look at block comment in gedcom xml writer

* Questions
** Refactoring

* Retrospective

Happy with
- clarification of roles and implementation of roles through testing
- dependency injection
- making data behaviour

Areas for improvement
- refactoring of add_id and add_tag to dry up implementation
- refactoring of each in gedcom_parser to make method easier to understand
  found it difficult to elegantly split the two paths of the if into
  their own methods but this would be a worthwhile exercise
