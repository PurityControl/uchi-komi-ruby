#+TITLE: Notes for first repetition of madlibs

* Implementation thoughts

** Dependency Injection

- Take ichi repetition and build in dependency injection

** Questions

- Should the internal hash be its own class implementing enumerable?

** Next?

- refactor and improve variable and function names
- refactor extract out classes for single responsibility
- pass classes in as dependency injection

** Reflection - is it any better ?
