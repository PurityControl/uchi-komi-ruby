#+TITLE: LCD Numbers (#14)

* Problem Description

Write a program that displays LCD style numbers at adjustable sizes.

The digits to be displayed will be passed as an argument to the program.
Size should be controlled with the command-line option -s follow up by a
positive integer. The default value for -s is 2.

For example, if your program is called with:

> lcd.rb 012345

The correct display is:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
 --    --   --        --
|  | |    |   | |  | |
|  | |    |   | |  | |
        --  --   --   --
|  | | |      |    |    |
|  | | |      |    |    |
 --     --  --        --
#+END_SRC


And for:

> lcd.rb -s 1 6789

Your program should print:
#+BEGIN_SRC 

 -  -   -   -
|    | | | | |
 -      -   -
| |  | | |   |
 -      -   -

#+END_SRC

Note the single column of space between digits in both examples.
For other values of -s, simply lengthen the - and | bars.
