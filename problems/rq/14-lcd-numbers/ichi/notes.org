#+TITLE: Notes for first repetition of lcd numbers

* Implementation thoughts
** Classes
- LcdNumber, responsible for outputting a string representing the number
- LcdMapping, responsible for returning integers as a bitmap mask
- LcdOutput, responsible for returning a "string" representing whether
  there should be output at an Lcd postion. Also stores constants representing
  the postions of an Lcd Display


* Features
** TODO Tasks
- [X] remove redundant methods in LcdOutput and push responsibitlity for
  rendering back into calling class
- [ ] LcdOutput could take on rendering responsibility if there was a 
  method that took a block?
- [ ] identify roles
- [ ] set up tests highlighting what those roles are

* Questions

* Retrospective
